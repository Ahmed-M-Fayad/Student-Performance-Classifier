# Student Readiness Classifier

## Overview
The Student Readiness Classifier is a data-driven system developed to categorize students based on their early problem-solving interactions.  
The project aims to support personalized education by providing insights into student performance from the very first engagement.

## Dataset
The system is built using a curated and cleaned dataset from ASSISTments, consisting of over 1 million student-problem interactions.  
The dataset features high-quality labels, consistent formatting, and a rich set of attributes essential for readiness classification.

## Purpose
This project lays the foundation for an adaptive system capable of analyzing student behavior and facilitating more effective learning experiences.  
All development steps, from data preparation to modeling activities, are documented and maintained within this repository.
